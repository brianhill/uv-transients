The (0.1 to 0.3s) "flares that (they) detect have a typical magnitude of 9–11, which translates to ∼14–16th magnitude if diluted by a 30 s exposure time. We estimate the rate of events brighter than ∼11 mag to be of the order of 30–40 events per day per deg2 , for declinations between −20 and +10, not including the declination corresponding to the geostationary belt directly above the equator, where the rate can be higher." "By observing in the direction of the Earth’s shadow, we are able to put an upper limit on the rate of fast astrophysical transients of 0.052 deg−2 day−1 for events brighter than 11 mag."

The numbers in the abstract should be per hour not per day.

add 2.5 * log(3) = 1.2 to the 9-11 estimate, giving 10-12.

They remove LEO because they leave streaks and they use a radon transform to identify streaks.

They suggest looking in the Earth's shadow and using a baseline >1 km.
